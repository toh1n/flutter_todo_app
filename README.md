●     Create a Flutter project on Task Management.

●     Implement a main screen that displays a list of tasks.

●     Add a floating action button (FAB) that opens a dialog to add a new task.

●     When the user clicks the FAB, display a dialog with text fields to input task details such as title, description, and deadline.

●     Implement a "Save" button in the dialog to add the new task to the task list.

●     Display the added tasks in the main screen's list.

●     Implement a long press gesture on each task item in the list to open a bottom sheet.

●     The bottom sheet should show the task details along with an option to  delete the task.

●     The bottom sheet will always be closed when delete is pressed.

●     Ensure that the parent screen updates automatically with the modified task details.
